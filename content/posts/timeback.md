*Let me share my screen.*

*Can you see this?*

**Can you hear me.**



while you nod I…

…prepare to be disrespected because i’m not attractive enough

…prepare for you to avoid eye contact because I’m too hot 

…prepare to be rejected because I’m too confident 

…prepare to be forgotten because I’m too deferential

…prepare for the silence when I’m too emotional

…prepare to be counted out because I’m too feminine

…prepare for chad to present my idea as his own 

…prepare to cause confusion because I cross my legs like a man

…prepare to do the work that nobody else will 

…prepare for my name to be botched, my intellect to be underestimated, my patience to be tried, my knowledge to be discredited.

3-7 times a day, 5 minutes after the hour. 

*You’re on mute.*
