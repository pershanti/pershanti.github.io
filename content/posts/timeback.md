# Enjoy the time back 

*Let me share my screen.*

*Can you see this?*

**Can you hear me.**

while you nod, I inhale and prepare

to be disrespected because i’m a hot mess

for you to look away because I’m too hot 

for your insecurity-fed rage because I’m too confident 

to be bulldozed because I’m too deferential

for the awkward silence when I’m too emotional

to be counted out because I’m too feminine

for chad to present my idea as his own 

for your confused glances at my legs crossed like a man's 

for my ambition to cause fear

to have my boundaries trampled

for my name to be botched

for my intellect to be underestimated

for my dreams to be too big

for me to be *too much*

3-7 times a day, 5 minutes after the hour. 

**You’re on mute.**
