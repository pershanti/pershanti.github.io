I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Apple platform development. 

I work on Apple's Notes app for both iOS and macOS.
Previously I've worked on engineering teams in Apple Media Products and Apple Retail Apps.

I spent some time working on iOS apps at Twitter and Owl Cameras (purchased by Amazon). 

You can learn more about my background in this [post](/posts/how-i-got-into-tech/).

I'm very much a [dog person](http://instagram.com/pokeyTails).

I've won several pun competitions, but I mostly keep my punning to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/shantinix) these days. 

Recently I've started contributing to the [Swift language](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-add-equatable-and-hashable-conformance-to-string-views/60449). 

My spouse is really [talented and cool](http://smvyas.github.io).
