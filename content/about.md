I'm a software engineer with > 5 years of experience in Apple platform development. 
I currently work on Apple's Notes app.
I am self-taught, and had a previous career in biotech. 
You can learn more about my background in this [post](/posts/how-i-got-into-tech/).

I'm very much a [dog person](http://instagram.com/pokeyTails).

Iâ€™m a Swiftie (Taylor) and a Swiftie (programming). 

Recently I've started contributing to the [Swift language](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-add-equatable-and-hashable-conformance-to-string-views/60449). 

My spouse is really [talented and cool](http://smvyas.github.io).
