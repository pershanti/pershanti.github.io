&lt;p>I studied Public Health at Johns Hopkins, where I did research in virology and graduated in 2012. After graduating I continued working in virology in government, academia, and industry. In 2016, I wrote some code to analyze data I&amp;rsquo;d been working with. Learning the code, solving pesky bugs, and finally seeing the end result gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment I&amp;rsquo;d ever had. I knew I had to keep doing it. I quit in 2016 to study programming full-time through self-teaching, online courses, and a bootcamp. I got my first job in tech in 2018.&lt;/p>
